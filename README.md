# CRNNeeg-sleep

## Introduction:
This page contains the necessary code to run CRNNeeg, a deep learning algorithm for automatically sleep staging PSG and long-term scalp EEG recordings. CRNNeeg is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) that extracts the temporal dependencies of sleep stages. The methods used to develop this algorithm and the expected performance are presented in https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa112.

CRNNeeg is implemented in Python (3.6), running Keras (2.2.3) with Tensorflow (1.12.0) as backend. Currently, only the cpu implementation of CRNNeeg is provided.

## How to use:
Step 1: Import the class Sleepdetector
```
from sleepdetector import Sleepdetector
```

Step 2: Construct an instance of Sleepdetector, and load its weights (weights are included in this repo)
```
weights_cnn_path =  'cnn_weights.hdf5'
weights_lstm_path = 'lstm_weights.h5'
CRNNeeg = Sleepdetector(cnn_path = weights_cnn_path, lstm_path = weights_lstm_path)
```

Step 3: Predict sleep stages using the method .predict() and input **x**
```
y_hat = CRNNeeg.predict(x)
```

**x** is a sequence of consecutive 30s EEG epochs that consists of 4 channels: F3-C3, C3-O1, F4-C4, and C4-O2.

**x** has a shape of (4, n, 3000, 1), where *4* corresponds to the number of channels, *n* corresponds to the number of 30s epochs, and *3000* corresponds to the number of samples of each 30s segment (= time x sampling_frequency = 30s x 100Hz = 3000)

The output **yhat** is an array of sleep stages, where 4 = Awake, 3 = REM, 2 = N1, 1 = N2, and 0 = N3.

An example is provided in **main.py**, where CRNNeeg is applied on the PSG recording 'abc-baseline-900001' of the ABC dataset[1][2][3].

### Important Note:
To ensure optimal operation of the sleep staging algorithm, the polarity of the signals used should be such that eyeblinks result in an **upward deflection** in F3-C3 and F4-C4, as shown in the figure below.
